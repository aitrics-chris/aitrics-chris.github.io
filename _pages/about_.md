Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href="https://zicokolter.com/">Prof. Zico Kolter</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/">Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov</a>. During my PhD, I have interned at Sony AI working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oyuTmwoAAAAJ&hl=ja">Naoki Murata</a> and <a href="https://www.yukimitsufuji.com/">Yuki Mitsufuji</a>, and Meta FAIR working with <a href="https://rtqichen.github.io/">Ricky Chen</a>.
 <!-- A part of my PhD was sponsored by Sony AI. -->

Before coming to CMU, I was a master's student at Stanford Computer Science with distinction in research. I was advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/">Prof. Stefano Ermon</a>, and closely worked with <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Prof. Christopher Manning</a>,  <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell">Prof. David Lobell</a> and  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/">Prof. Marshall Burke</a>. I completed my B.S in Mathematics and B.S. in Data Science with highest distinction at University of Rochester, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/">Prof. Henry Kautz</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/">Prof. Jiebo Luo</a>.  

I was selected as a <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2020/10/08/16-stanford-graduate-students-named-2021-siebel-scholars/">Siebel Scholar</a> and a Xerox Engineering Research Fellow. I was also awarded an <a href="https://blog.iclr.cc/2022/04/20/announcing-the-iclr-2022-outstanding-paper-award-recipients/">Outstanding Paper Award at ICLR 2022</a> and Doris Ermine Smith Award for Achievement in Mathematics.

My research interests include generative models, more specifically diffusion models and flow matching related topics, and how to properly use them in broader contexts.
