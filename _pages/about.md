I am a machine learning researcher at [AITRICS](https://aitrics.com/en), a healthcare AI startup in South Korea, advised by [Prof. Eunho Yang](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/) and collaborating closely with [Prof. Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/).

My research focuses on inductive bias and symmetry-aware learning: how to design learning systems that generalize reliably by encoding principled regularities (e.g., geometry, acquisition processes, and temporal structure). I have worked on geometric priors [[1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TuQW7VPfXF)], acquisition-informed priors [[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10595), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05771)], and temporal/observation-process priors for multimodal EHR trajectories [[4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02504), [5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16598)].

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI)](https://www.keti.re.kr/eng/main/main.php) and in the RCV Lab at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with [Prof. In So Kweon](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/). I also collaborated with clinicians and researchers at the [National Cancer Center](https://www.ncc.re.kr/indexEn.ncc).

I am currently investigating invariance–equivariance interference. During my PhD, I aim to move beyond hand-specified groups and geometry: toward learned symmetries and semantic/physical plausibility constraints ([Research Statement]({{ '/assets/pdf/Research_Summary_JoohyungLee.pdf' | relative_url }})).
